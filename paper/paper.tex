\problem{
VR environments become more and more important in visualization and engineering
applications. In order to provide a comfortable experience without risk of
motion sickness a rendering framerate of 90fps needs to be ensured. Framerate is
even more important than image quality. The goal of this thesis is the
development of an incremental rendering approach for large point cloud data that
can guarantee the necessary framerate by rendering only a subset of the points
per frame and by accumulation information over several frames.

The specific tasks are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Literature research on point cloud rendering and incremental rendering
	approaches
\item Justified selection of an incremental rendering approach for basic point
	cloud rendering that guarantees a user-defined framerate and converges
	to a good approximation of a non-incremental rendering without framerate
	limitations.
\item Implementation of the selected approach in a plugin to the CGV framework
\item Evaluation of the achieved image quality for stereoscopic rendering at
	90fps with a suitable image quality metric for several point clouds of
	different sizes in comparison to a non-incremental rendering approach.
\end{itemize}

Optional Tasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimization of the rendering approach for stereoscopic render
\item Implementation of an advanced hole-free point cloud rendering approach
\end{itemize}
